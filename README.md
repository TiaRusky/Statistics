# Statistics
This repository is used to take track of all statistic's projects

1 : A simple application that plays with handlers

2: An Application that use the objects Random & Timer, and an application that implements a CSV parser & compute a univariate distribution

3: Do a capture, and the following statistics, with Wireshark and the set a RV to compute the distribution

4: Simulate a sequence of coin tosses (0 for success, 1 for failure) where the probability of success is a parameter and draw a dynamic chart of the Absolute (Blue) , Relative (Red)  and Normalized frequencies (Green)

5: Given a distribution, draw istogram column chart with vertical and horizontal orientation (ColumnChart). Given a box/rectangle, enable its movement and resizing via mouse

6: Take a population, fix a RV X and define the distribution of E(X) and Var(X) in a seq of n sampling of size m

7: Define a toin toss seq with winning probability = lambda/n, with n= number of trials. Reapeat the experiemnts N times and draw success distribution and interarravil distribution
